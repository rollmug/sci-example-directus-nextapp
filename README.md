This is a sample of the directory structure and files for the SCIOWA install with Directus and the NextJS playlist app.

See the `docker-compose.yml` file and the `sample.env.local` file for examples. 

**NOTE:** the `sample.env.local` should be renamed to `.env.local` and moved into the `sci-cosmic-playlist` directory.

## Running

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```
